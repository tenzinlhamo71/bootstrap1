            When we are faced with difficult times as we are now with the effects of a worldwide pandemic, it is easy to get discouraged and lose hope.  Hope is a vital component of human existence, and it is needed to find happiness and peace during times that might otherwise lead us to be discouraged.  As Andrew Carnegie so clearly pointed out, setting a goal can keep your thoughts focused, direct your energy, and inspire the hope that is needed to move through and beyond a moment of despair.<br><br>
            Have you ever wondered why some people are so good at fulfilling their dreams and living a life of purpose? What is their "secret sauce" for success? <br><br>

            Some people would say that all you need to do is work hard to achieve what you want in life. Some people think it's about who you know or what you have.  Yet others feel there are those born with access and that they are given all the breaks in life.  The truth is, statistics demonstrate that those who create goals and have a regular and consistent goal-setting process are much more likely to achieve their lifeâ€™s dreams.<br><br>

            Regardless of how hard you work, if you are aiming for the wrong dream, then all that effort will only get you to the wrong destination faster, and that would be extremely disappointing.<br><br>

            Despite connections, you still have to continuously demonstrate to everyone that you were worthy of receiving the opportunity in the first place.  Eventually, proving your worth to others becomes exhausting.
            However, there is a formula for turning your dreams into reality, and it isn't dependent on who you know or proving yourself.  The formula is: <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     goals + commitment = dreams come true<br><br>
            
            By having clear goals, you become aware of precisely what you want to achieve and how to go about doing it. You are able to more accurately assess and measure your ability to accomplish the goals and most importantly, you have a plan that can guide you along the way and keep you on track.<br><br>
            
            Add commitment and determination to your goals and you will find that you are willing to take continuous and consistent action toward making your dreams a reality, despite any obstacles in your path, including difficult times.<br><br>
            
            Having goals and staying committed to them will keep your focus on the things that you have identified as essential to reaching your desired outcomes.  Too often, we expend precious time on issues that have nothing to do with what we really want in our lives. We get distracted by focusing on what others are doing and achieving, and striving to do the same.
            Having a vision and a supporting plan of what you want to achieve in life is necessary if you ever want to arrive at the correct destination.<br><br>

            We know that this is a very difficult time and staying focused during the COVID-19 pandemic can definitely be a challenge.  We also know that life will continue for the vast majority of people during and after this pandemic.  Now, more than ever, we believe that it is important to stay focused on something that can drive you through this difficult time.  Because of this, weâ€™ve put together a Goal-Setting Guide to help you get on track to achieving goals and manifesting your lifeâ€™s dreams.<br><br>

            That's why we are providing a Goal Setting Toolkit to help you identify your goals and create a plan to keep you on track. We hope that it will help motivate and encourage you to stay focused on your goals and develop a plan to reach your lifeâ€™s dreams, even during this difficult time.<br><br>

            We also encourage you to listen to the FREE Goal Setting audio course here on our website.
